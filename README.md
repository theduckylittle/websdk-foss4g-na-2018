# WebSDK 2018 Presentation

by: Dan 'Ducky' Little

## Abstract

React and Redux provide an awesome front-end development framework!
But what about making maps? OpenLayers provides an excellent map
rendering engine but doesn't play nice with React + Redux.
Mapbox styles provide a clean JSON style definition.
But how to put them together? Learn how the Boundless Web SDK uses
Mapbox styles, OpenLayers, React, and Redux to provide a modern
ES6 SDK for making maps.
